      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">
        Hello, I'm Michal Kozdon, a passionate Software and AI Engineer with a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence, IoT development, and back-end engineering. I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, graduating cum laude with a 9/10 average.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">
        From developing real-time AI models at the Netherlands Aerospace Centre to implementing IoT solutions with Cognizant and contributing to scalable software projects at Novusoft, I have honed my expertise in Python, C#, Java, and modern frameworks like TensorFlow, Azure, and Kubernetes. My projects often focus on merging innovation with practical solutions, including edge computing, machine learning, and sensor integration.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">
        Beyond the technical, my international experiences including a Minor in Japanese Studies in Tokyo have fostered adaptability and effective collaboration within diverse, multicultural teams. This, combined with my commitment to excellence, allows me to bridge technical innovation and user centric design seamlessly.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">
        Driven by curiosity and a passion for impactful development, I am eager to innovate, create, and contribute to meaningful projects that make the world a better place.
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">
        I am currently seeking new opportunities to leverage my skills in software development, AI engineering, and IoT solutions to drive impactful projects and contribute to a forward-thinking team. If you're interested in collaborating or discussing potential projects, please don't hesitate to reach out.
